For the needs of professors and assistants at FINKI, a program is required to scale the scores of students for a given exam.

From the standard input, the scores of up to 100 students are to be read and stored in an array.

Define a function void scale(int scores[], int n) that takes an array of numbers (the scores of students on the exam) and performs the scaling as follows:

Find the maximum score on the exam (e.g., 88 out of 100).
Calculate the ratio
100/max
100/max (e.g.,
100/88
=
1.13636
100/88=1.13636).
Multiply all the scores in the array by this ratio so that the student with the highest score gets 100 points.
Print the array with the scaled scores.
The transformation should be done in-place, without using an auxiliary array.

void scale(int *scores, int n) {
    int max = scores[0];

        if (max < scores[i]) {
            max = scores[i];
        }
    }
    float ratio = 100.0/max;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float scaledScore = scores[i] * ratio;
        cout << fixed << setprecision(2) << scaledScore << " ";
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int scores[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> scores[i];
    }
    scale(scores, n);
